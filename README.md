# Phishing URL Detection â€” Model Validation & Real-World Results

This section showcases how the LightGBM + lexical/TF-IDF model performs on both **benchmarked phishing URLs (PhishTank)** and **real-world phishing attempts** (phonetic lookalikes, SMS attacks).  

## Validation Against PhishTank

We validated the model using URLs listed in [PhishTank](https://phishtank.org/).  
Our predictions match PhishTankâ€™s ground-truth verdicts with high confidence.
